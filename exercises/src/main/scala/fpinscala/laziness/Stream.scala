   * Exercise 5.6:

   * Implement map, filter, append, and flatMap using foldRight. Because the
   * implementations are incremental, chains of transformations will avoid fully
   * instantiating the intermediate data structures.
   *
   * Let's look at a simplified program trace for (a fragment of) the motivating
   * example we started this chapter with,
   *
   * {{{
   *  Stream(1,2,3,4).map(_ + 10).filter(_ % 2 == 0)
   *  (11 #:: Stream(2,3,4).map(_ + 10)).filter(_ % 2 == 0)     // apply map to first element
   *  Stream(2,3,4).map(_ + 10).filter(_ % 2 == 0)              // apply filter to first element
   *  (12 #:: Stream(3,4).map(_ + 10)).filter(_ % 2 == 0)       // apply map to second element
   *  12 #:: Stream(3,4).map(_ + 10).filter(_ % 2 == 0)         // apply filter to second element
   *  12 #:: (13 #:: Stream(4).map(_ + 10)).filter(_ % 2 == 0)
   *  12 #:: Stream(4).map(_ + 10).filter(_ % 2 == 0)
   *  12 #:: (14 #:: Stream().map(_ + 10)).filter(_ % 2 == 0)
   *  12 #:: 14 #:: Stream().map(_ + 10).filter(_ % 2 == 0)
   *  12 #:: 14 #:: Stream()
   * }}}
   *
   * Notice how the filter and map transformations are interleavedâ€”the
   * computation alternates between generating a single element of the output of
   * map, and filter testing to see if that element is divisible by 2 (adding it
   * to the output stream if it is), exactly as if we had interleaved these bits
   * of logic in a special-purpose loop that combined both transformations.
   *
   * Notice we do not fully instantiate the intermediate stream that results
   * from the map. For this reason, people sometimes describe streams as
   * "first-class loops" whose logic can be combined using higher-order functions
   * like map and filter. The incremental nature of stream transformations also
   * has important consequences for memory usage. In a sequence of stream
   * transformations like this, the garbage collector can usually reclaim the
   * space needed for each intermediate stream element, as soon as that element
   * is passed on to the next transformation. Here, for instance, the garbage
   * collector can reclaim the space allocated for the value 13 emitted by map
   * as soon as filter determines it isn't needed. Of course, this is a simple
   * example; in other situations we might be dealing with larger numbers of
   * elements, and the stream elements themselves could be large objects that
   * retain significant amounts of memory. Being able to reclaim this memory as
   * quickly as possible can cut down on the amount of memory required by your
   * program as a whole.
